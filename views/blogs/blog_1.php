        <!-- Intro -->
        <p style="padding: 40px 0 0 0;">
            Want to know what it's like to attend a coding boot camp? I wrote this article to answer the questions I wish were answered for me before I even applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to keep the article as objective and fact-filled as possible. In another post I will give my personal opinion on specifics such as the worth of the program and whether or not it can compete with a <strong>college education</strong> or being <strong>self-taught</strong>.
            I attended <strong>Trilogy's Full-Time, Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp</strong> between February of 2019 and May of 2019. What I mean by <i>full-time</i> is that in order to get the most out of the program, it was expected that each student spend at least 40 hours outside of class working on homework, group projects, or studying. Looking back, I think this number was completely arbitrary and depends on how you learn and how much you already know.
            And the term <i>full-stack</i> implies that students learn how to build websites that use front-end and back-end technologies. I will explain in detail which languages, frameworks, and libraries we learned.

        <!-- Average Day -->
        <h2>What Does The Average Day Look Like?</h2>
        <p>The list belows outlines what an average weekday was like for me during the boot camp.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>7:30 AM</strong> - Wake up and do morning routine, e.g., eat, get dressed, etc...
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>7:55 AM</strong> - Begin commute to campus.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>8:45 AM</strong> - Show up to class. 
                Classes were held at the University of Texas' Thompson Conference Center. 
                I would show up early to catch up on studies or homework and to break up study blocks. I took to heart the 40 hours of work expectation because of the financial and time investment I was making. 
                That being said, I would have been burnt out early on if I did not divide my study time into digestible blocks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>9:30 AM</strong> - Office hours begin. This is an opportunity for students to get one-on-one help from any of the 4 teaching assistants or the instructor.
                Unfortunately the TAs were usually about 10-15 minutes late, so it was difficult to get much face time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>10:00 AM</strong> - Class would begin. We would usually start class by doing a whiteboard question. 
                We could choose to work alone or with partners. 
                After about 15 minutes of discussion, the instructor would ask someone to share their answer and move on with class.
                <br>
                What we did after the warm up depended on whether it was an <i>instruction week</i> or a <i>project week</i>. 
                If it was an instruction week, the instructor would lecture about technology. 
                I will get into the details later down the page.
                If it was a project week, we would put our tables together with our group members. 
                TAs would float around the class and answer questions or sometimes sit in the back and play fortnite.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>12:00 PM</strong> - Lunch. I would usually spend about 15-20 minutes eating and chatting with classmates. 
                Most people would buy from the cafeteria. Some people would go off campus, and some would bring their lunch.
                The remaining time was spent catching up on studies and homework.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>12:45 PM</strong> - Class time again. Like the morning, this time was used for lecture or project work.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>2:30 PM</strong> - End of class and beginning of afternoon office hours. 
                Most people would leave at this time, but some of us would stick around to work on homework or get help from TAs.
                Sometimes a TA would offer to help us with some whiteboard questions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>3:00 PM</strong> - Leave campus. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>4:00 PM</strong> - Get home, eat an early dinner, and then it was back to doing homework and projects. 
                I would work from home, go to a coffee shop, or meet up with classnames.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>10:00 PM</strong> - Stop working on code and i don't know, try to actually live a life? This time would change depending on the difficult and length of the current assignment, but I tried to always have my laptop put away by 11:00 PM.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>12:00 AM</strong> - Go to sleep.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you can see, the boot camp consumed all of my time. As i mentioned before, this was a huge financial investment for me, and I was determined to make every minute count while I had access to these resources.
